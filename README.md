# AutoAI TaskMaster

AutoAI TaskMaster is an innovative project designed to bridge the gap between AutoHotkey's scripting capabilities and OpenAI's AI technology. Its primary goal is to simplify and automate various desktop activities, creating a more efficient and intelligent workflow.

## Features

- **AutoHotkey Integration**: AutoAI TaskMaster harnesses AutoHotkey's scripting prowess to automate routine desktop tasks such as window management, text manipulation, and automated inputs.

- **OpenAI Desktop Automation**: Integrating OpenAI's AI models, the project offers advanced capabilities like natural language processing, predictive text, and decision-making algorithms.

- **Virtual Employee Agent**: This feature acts as an automated coworker, adept at handling tasks like data entry, report generation, and custom task automation based on user preferences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AutoHotkey software.
- Access to specific OpenAI models tailored for desktop automation applications.

### Installation

1. **Install AutoHotkey**: Download AutoHotkey from the official site and follow the installation guide.
2. **Configure OpenAI Models**: Register for an OpenAI account, obtain API access, and configure the necessary AI models following the provided instructions.
3. **Finalize Setup**: Complete the setup by installing any additional dependencies required for optimal interaction between AutoHotkey and OpenAI models.

## Usage

- **Automated Scheduling**: Create AutoHotkey scripts that work with OpenAI models to manage and schedule calendar events based on email and message content.
- **Smart File Sorting**: Use OpenAI's AI to analyze file contents and organize them intelligently, executed via AutoHotkey scripts.
